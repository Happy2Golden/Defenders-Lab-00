# üõ∞Ô∏è Mission 01: Open Port Patrol

## Objective
Map and analyze the local network and exposed services to better defend the perimeter.

## Tools Used
- `nmap` for port scanning and OS detection
- `ip` for discovering addresses
- `ss` for checking local services
- `ping`, `traceroute` (optional) for exploring reachability

## Targets Scanned
- Localhost (127.0.0.1)
- Default Gateway (your router)
- scanme.nmap.org

## Key Findings
- [ ] Localhost has port ___ open (e.g. SSH or web)
- [ ] Gateway OS appears to be ___
- [ ] scanme.nmap.org returned ____

## Defender Insight
Being aware of exposed services is crucial. If a port is open, it should either be monitored, patched, or closed.
